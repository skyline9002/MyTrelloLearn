How To Open The Programme

1. This project use nuget to manage the packages, make sure your VS have nuget extension.
2. This project will use SQL Server V11 localdb, I am not sure whether it will be compatible with over version.
3. Go to Web.config to replace your App key and App secret for Trello oauth.
